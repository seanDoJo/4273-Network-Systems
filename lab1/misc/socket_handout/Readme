There are two programs in this directory. They illustrate the use of TCP and
select() system call.

The echoServer.c contains an ECHO server program that implements an ECHO
service. After establishing connections with clients, an ECHO server receives
byte strings from them and echos them back. The ECHO server can service
multiple clients concurrently. It uses port number 5004 as the default port.
Another port number pn may be specified as a command line parameter.
If during binding process, it finds that port 5004 (or pn) is in use, it
requests the system to allocate a port, and prints the new port number on
standard output.

USAGE: echoServer [port]

The echoClient.c contains an ECHO client program. An ECHO client first
establishes a connection with the ECHO server, and then repeatedly reads 
character strings from standard input, sends them to the ECHO server, receives
them from the ECHO server, and then prints them on the standard output.

USAGE: echoClient [port [host]]

Compile these programs as follows: 

gcc -o echoServer echoServer.c 
gcc -o echoClient echoClient.c

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: These programs are a modification of the ECHO server and
ECHO client programs presented in the book `Internetworking with TCP/IP',
Volume 3, Prentice Hall 2001, by D. E. Comer and D. L. Stevens.
